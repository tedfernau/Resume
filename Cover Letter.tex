{\noindent\sc\bf SUMMARY}\vspace{.5pc}\\
\indent My time at Nightforce Optics has allowed my to develop embedded hardware and software for interesting and important projects. I have gained a great amount of experience in a short period of time due to the small team and various duties of my position. I think my experience is a good fit for this position. Some of my work even involved interfacing with a Vive system. \\

\indent My current position is great, but I transplanted our young family out to rural Idaho. This will not be sustainable, so I am beginning the hunt for a new position. \\

\indent I see big things coming for gaming in the coming decades, and I think Valve is at the cutting edge. The technology demonstrated by the gaming industry will filter out and improve peoples lives beyond entertainment. \\

\indent Below I have included a summary of my experience with regards to the position qualifications.

 \hline
 \textbf{Demonstrated start-to-finish design skills with industry-standard CAD/EDA tools (Altium Designer experience strongly preferred), including schematic entry, PCB layout, component definition, and CAD library management} & I was lucky to get a taste of embedded system development and Altium Designer in my EE program. This prepared me for my current position in which I use Altium Designer nearly every day for schematic capture and PCB design.     \\ 
  \hline
  
 \textbf{Hands-on electronics prototyping experience, including soldering and rework of fine-pitch SMT components} & My current position can be best summarized as mixed signal and embedded systems development from concept to production samples. I build and debug our circuit boards.   \\
 \hline
 
 \textbf{Strong lab skills, including the use of common test and measurement equipment (oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, etc.) to debug complex electronic circuits} & This is a large part of my current position.   \\
 \hline
 
 \textbf{Experience with embedded systems design and strong knowledge of common digital communication interfaces (USB, SPI, I2C)} & I use SPI, I2C, and UART mostly, but am just digging into USB and am eager to become proficient enough to support USB functionality in all my projects.   \\
 \hline
 
 \textbf{Experience working directly on-site with contract manufacturers} & I have collaborated with contract manufacturers in sourcing PCBs and PCBAs, but have not been on-site with them.  \\ [1ex] 
 \hline
 
  \textbf{Ability to think and work across disciplines} & I collaborate across engineering disciplines at my current position, and I a always hungry to learn and broaden my skills.   \\ [1ex]

 \hline
 \textbf{A proven track record of designing and shipping high-volume consumer electronics products} & Much of my work has been in product development,from proof of concept to the production samples. I have not seen the final phase of shipping products yet.   \\ 
  \hline
 \textbf{Experience in design for manufacture and design for test (DFM/DFT) of electronic devices} & DFM/DFT guide every system and PCB design I do, but I have mostly designed, built, and tested prototypes. I am eager to improve my DFM/DFT practice for mass production.   \\
 \hline
 \textbf{Bachelorâ€™s degree (or equivalent) in electrical engineering or a related field} & Yes, BS in Electrical Engineering, Embedded Systems focus.  \\
 \hline
 \textbf{5+ years experience in electronics design} & I have been designing electronics professionally for about 2 years, but began designing year 3 of college, so about 4 years.\\

& Yes.        I have simulated circuits in LTspice and similar.
        Our designs are battery powered and must be power frugal. 
        I have designed battery management and charging circuits. 
        I have done a small amount of antenna design.
        I have used 32-bit ARM cores.
        I have developed with moderately high speed technology (USB, SRAM). I am eager to improve my high speed capabilities.
        In college we did a bit of DSP. I enjoyed it and would love to learn more.
        Our products are designed for EMC, but I have not been through testing yet. 
        Yes, I use C for all embedded firmware so far.
        In college I did a bit of FPGA design, I am eager for more since this technology seems to be emerging.
